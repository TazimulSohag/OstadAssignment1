        Biryani is a popular rice-based dish that originated in the Indian
        subcontinent but is now enjoyed in many parts of the world. It is a
        flavorful and aromatic dish that typically consists of long-grain rice,
        meat (such as chicken, lamb, or beef), and a blend of spices and herbs.
